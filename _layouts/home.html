<p>
    Chris, better known as Kraedt (pronounced 'Crate'), is an Electronic Dance Music producer from Wisconsin. He began
    producing late 2010, and got serious about it sometime in 2011. Electro House, Progressive House, and Drum n' Bass
    are his 'forte', with high energy as the main theme in most of his tracks. Starting fresh from an earlier alias,
    Kraedt strives to drop the bass and have fun doing it!
